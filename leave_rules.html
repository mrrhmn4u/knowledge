          <h1>Leave Rules for AP & Telangana Government Employees</h1>
          <p>As government employees, being aware of the applicable leave rules is crucial for planning and availing different types of leaves effectively. The state governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have well-defined policies that cover a wide range of leave entitlements for their workforce. Let's dive into the nuances of these rules.</p>
          <h2>Casual Leaves</h2>
          <p>Every employee, whether temporary or permanent, is eligible for 15 days of casual leave (CL) per calendar year. These leaves can be conveniently combined with optional holidays, public holidays, and special casual leaves, subject to a maximum continuous absence of 10 days. While the rules discourage frequent availing of CL, they serve as a handy provision for short, informal breaks.</p>

          <h2>Maternity Leaves</h2>
          <p>The rules prioritize the well-being of expectant mothers by offering 180 days of maternity leave on full pay, applicable for up to two surviving children. This leave can be clubbed with other leaves, subject to a medical certificate. Temporary employees may also be granted maternity leave at the discretion of the sanctioning authority, based on their length of service.</p>

          <h2>Paternity Leaves</h2>
          <p>Not just mothers, but fathers too are entitled to a well-deserved break. Married male government employees can avail 15 days of paternity leave on full pay, subject to the condition of having less than two surviving children. This leave can be taken either 15 days before or within six months from the date of delivery.</p>

          <h2>Child Care Leaves</h2>
          <p>In a progressive move, the governments have introduced a 90-day child care leave for women employees. This leave can be availed in a minimum of three spells to take care of the two eldest children up to 18 years of age or a disabled child up to 22 years. While not a matter of right, this leave acknowledges the dual responsibilities of working mothers.</p>

          <h2>Half Pay Leaves</h2>
          <p>Employees earn 20 days of half-pay leave for every completed year of service, with no limit on accumulation. These leaves can be granted on medical grounds or for personal affairs, providing much-needed flexibility. Interestingly, employees suffering from specific illnesses like TB, cancer, or mental health issues can avail full salary for up to 6-8 months while on half-pay leave.</p>

          <h2>Earned Leaves</h2>
          <p>Permanent, non-vacation staff are credited with 15 days of earned leave in advance, every six months. These leaves can accumulate up to a specified limit, offering long-term leave planning opportunities. Teachers and school staff, too, are entitled to six days of earned leave per year, credited semi-annually.</p>

          <h2>Study Leaves</h2>
          <p>The rules encourage continuous learning by providing study leaves for up to two years over an employee's entire service tenure. These leaves, granted on half-pay, facilitate the pursuit of scientific or technical studies relevant to the employee's department.</p>

          <p>The governments have also introduced special provisions for SC/ST employees, allowing them to pursue higher education within the country on full pay, subject to specific conditions like signing a bond and meeting service requirements.</p>

          <p>The leave rules encompass a wide array of scenarios, from miscarriage and abortion leaves to child care leave that can be granted as leave not due. They reflect a progressive outlook, balancing workplace obligations with personal and familial responsibilities.</p>
